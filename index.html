 <!-- 
 Checkout to your 'add-css' branch, add CSS style, and commit changes
 Merge the add-css branch back into the master branch -->

    <p>A branch marks a point where the files in the repository diverged. Branches are a way to maintain alternate histories of a project you're working on. "git init" initializes a default branch called "master". </p>

    <p>Create branches when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> You're preparing to make major changes to your project</li>
        <li> Your're about to reset changes that you don't want to lose</li>
        <li>You're going to work on a feature that may or may not end up being included in the main project.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Reasons to make new branches:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Experimental changes</li>
        <li>New features</li>
        <li>Bug fixes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Merging takes two or more branches and combines their history into one branch.</p>
